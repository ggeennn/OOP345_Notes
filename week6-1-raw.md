# Introduction to the Standard Library

- Review standard library facilities and introduce some new facilities
- Provide an overview of the Standard Template Library

> "The Standard Template Library provides a set of well-structured generic components that work together in a seamless way" Stepanov and Lee (1995)

An object-oriented programming language like C++ relies significantly on libraries that support its non-library core. These libraries implement programming solutions for much of the repetitive detail encountered in the development of modern applications. The libraries that support the C++ language core include a broad variety of types, a framework of containers and algorithms for all user-defined types, and support for resource management and multi-threading. Two-thirds of the C++17 standard is devoted to detailed descriptions of library support facilities.

This chapter introduces the categories of the C++ standard library and summarizes their contents. It includes overviews of the string library, facilities added to the Standard Libraries with C++11 and the framework of containers and algorithms for user-defined types called the Standard Template Library. The chapter entitled [Introduction to Linked Lists](https://advoop.sdds.ca/H-Deeper-Detail/linked-list-technology) describes the technology that underlies some of the containers.

Most library components are declared and defined in the `std` namespace. The filesystem component is declared and defined in the `filesystem` namespace. The library macros are predefined in the global namespace.

The C++ Standard Library makes available the facilities of the C Standard Library. A review of the input/output features is in the appendices entitled [The C Libraries](https://advoop.sdds.ca/Resources-Appendices/c-libraries) and [How C++ and C Fit Together](https://advoop.sdds.ca/Resources-Appendices/c-and-cpp).

## String Library

The String Library provides support for three general types of strings:

- the `string` classes
- the `string_view` classes
- null terminated C-style string functions

### String Classes

The `string` classes store and manipulate sequences of character-like objects. The specializations of the `<std::basic_string<CharT>>` template for specific character types are:

- `std::string <std::basic_string<char>>`
- `std::wstring <std::basic_string<wchar_t>>`
- `std::u16string <std::basic_string<char16_t>>`
- `std::u32string <std::basic_string<char32_t>>`

The public member functions include:

- `operator=` \- assigns a string to the current string
- `operator[]` \- accesses a specified character in the string
- `size()` \- the number of characters in the string
- `substr()` \- returns a substring of the string
- `find(char c)` \- find the first occurrence of `c` in the string
- `rfind(char c)` \- find the last occurrence of `c` in the string
- `find_first_of(char c)` \- find the first occurrence of `c` in the string
- `find_last_of(char c)` \- find the last occurrence of `c` in the string
- `find_first_of(basic_string_view(const CharT* s))` \- find the first occurrence of any character in the sequence `s`
- `find_last_of(basic_string_view(const CharT* s))` \- find the last occurrence of any character in the sequence `s`
- `operator+=` \- append a character or a string to the current string

The helper functions include:

- `operator==` \- equality comparison
- `operator!=` \- inequality comparison
- `operator>>` \- extract the string from the input stream
- `operator<<` \- insert the string into the output stream

Unlike the `const char*` type (a pointer to a C-style null-terminated string), a string type keeps track of the number of characters in the string through an instance variable without using the null byte as a terminator. A string object can include one or more null byte ( `'\0'`) characters.

```cpp
// String Class
// string.cpp

#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main()
{
    std::string str("Hello");
    str += '\0'; // adds a null byte
    str += " World"; // adds a string

    int i = 0;

    for (const auto& c : str)
        if (str[i++] == '\0')
            std::cout << "Null byte at str[" << i-1 << "]\n";

    std::cout << str << std::endl;
}
```

```
Null byte at str[5]
Hello World
```

### String View Module

C++17 introduced the `<string_view>` library to augment the `std::string` class and avoid redundant copying operations. The class template `std::basic_string_view` defines a lightweight non-owning, read-only view into a contiguous sequence of characters with the first element at position zero.

The `string_view` classes refer to sequences of character-like objects. The specializations of the `std::basic_string_view<CharT>` template are:

- `std::string_view <char>`
- `std::wstring_view <wchar_t>`
- `std::u16string_view <char16_t>`
- `std::u32string_view <char32_t>`

The public member functions include:

- `operator=` \- assign one view to another
- `operator[]` \- access an element in a view
- `size()` \- the number of characters in the view
- `substr()` \- a substring of the view
- `find(char c)` \- find the first occurrence of `c` in the view
- `find_first_of(char c)` \- find the first occurrence of `c` in the view
- `find_last_of(char c)` \- find the last occurrence of `c` in the view
- `find_first_of(basic_string_view(const char* s))` \- find the first occurrence of any character in the sequence `s`
- `find_last_of(basic_string_view(const char* s))` \- find the last occurrence of any character in the sequence `s`

The helper functions include:

- `operator==` \- equality comparison
- `operator!=` \- inequality comparison
- `operator<<` \- insert into output stream

Like a `string` object, a `string_view` object can include the null byte ( `'\0'`) or several null bytes as a non-terminating character. Both achieve this by storing the number of characters in the string as an instance variable.

```cpp
// String View Class
// string_view.cpp

#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <string_view>

int main()
{
    std::string str("Hello");
    str += '\0'; // adds a null byte
    str += " World"; // adds a string

    int i = 0;

    std::string_view str_view(str);

    for (const auto& c : str_view)
        if (str_view[i++] == '\0')
            std::cout << "Null byte at str_view[" << i-1 << "]\n";

    std::cout << str_view << std::endl;
}
```

```
Null byte at str_view[5]
Hello World
```

Since a `string_view` object does not own the characters to which it points, it is the programmer's responsibility to ensure that the object does not outlive the pointed-to character array.

## Standard Template Library

The Standard Template Library (STL) is arguably the most prominent part of the C++ Standard Library. It provides code for managing the elements of a data structure in a generic form, hiding the complex details and allowing re-use. The STL consists of:

- container template classes
  - sequential containers
  - container adapters
  - associative containers (beyond scope)
- iterators
- algorithms
- function objects

A container class represents the shell of a data structure, manages the memory associated with the elements of that structure and provides member functions to access those elements. Iterators facilitate the traversal of the data structure and provide simple access to range of elements. Algorithms implement solutions for sequences of elements through the use of iterators and function objects.

A complete programming solution to the implementation of a data structure requires:

- the definition of the data type of each element in the data structure
- the choice of the optimal data structure to collect the elements
- the function object for the algorithm to use on the data structure
- syntax to accesses the facilities of the STL

This technology is covered in detail in the following two chapters. Parallel versions of the STL algorithms are covered in the chapter entitled [Multi-Threading](https://advoop.sdds.ca/G-Performance/multithreading).

## Recent Facilities

### C++11 Facilities

#### lvalue and rvalue Distinction

- `std::ref()` ( `<functional>`) \- returns an lvalue reference to its argument
- `std::move()` ( `<utility>`) \- returns an rvalue reference to its argument

### C++17 Facilities

C++17 introduced new library facilities. They include:

- `std::string_view` ( `<string_view>`) \- a read-only contiguous sequence of characters (see above)
- `std::variant<T, ...>()` ( `<variant>`) \- represents a type-safe union
- `std::optional<T>` ( `<optional>`) \- may or may not contain a value (beyond scope)
- `std::any` ( `<any>`) \- single values of any type (beyond scope)
- `std::uncaught_exceptions` ( `<exception>`) \- stack is in the process of unwinding
- Uniform container access `std::size` `std::empty` `std::data` \- number of elements, emptiness, direct access to underlying array
- Special Mathematical Functions ( `<numerics>`) \- (beyond scope)
- Filesystem Library `filesystem` ( `<filesystem>`) \- facilities for performing operations on file systems and their components including paths, regular files and directories (beyond scope)

#### Type-Safe Unions

The class template `std::variant<T, ...>` represents a type-safe union. The parameter list specifies the types that may be stored in the union. A type may be repeated. The value of the variant can be accessed using either its type, if unique, or its index.

The public member functions include:

- `operator=(v)` \- assigns value of variant `v` to the left operand
- `index()` \- returns the index I of the variant stored in the current object

The helper functions include:

- `std::get<T>(v)` \- returns value of variant `v` given the type `T`
- `std::get<I>(v)` \- returns value of variant `v` given the index `I`

The helper classes include:

- `std::bad_variant_access` \- exception thrown on invalid access

For example,

```cpp
// Variant - a type-safe union
// variant.cpp

#include <iostream>
#include <variant>

int main()
{
    std::variant<long, double> a, b;
    a = 12l; // a contains a long
    b = std::get<long>(a);
    std::cout << b << std::endl;

    try
    {
        double c = std::get<double>(b);
        std::cout << c << std::endl;
    }
    catch(std::bad_variant_access& bva)
    {
        std::cout << "bad type access" << std::endl;
    }
}
```

```
12
bad type access
```
