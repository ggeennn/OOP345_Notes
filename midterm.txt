Midterm Programming Details, Policy, and Integrity Agreement
Important: Please arrive on time.  



The midterm consists of two parts, Part 1: programming will be done before the study break and, part2: the concept will be done after the study break.



Part 1 – Concept Questions and Code Walkthroughs ~30%
Code Walkthrough Topics:
Variable shadowing
Static methods and attributes
Signature of main(): int main(int argc, char* argv[])
References and move references
#define statement vs typedef
Function templates: specializing and overloading
Concept Topics:
Translation units
Declaration vs definition
extern keyword
cv-qualifiers: const, volatile
typedef keyword
Scope of objects: automatic, static, dynamic
Compile-time, run-time, and pre-processing
lvalue, rvalue
Literal value types: L, UL, LL, etc.
Size of unions
Enum types (unscoped and scoped)


Part 2 – Programming ~70%
Maximum Time: 90 minutes

This part consists of five programming questions.

1- Move semantics (Rule of Five Focus) ~33 points

You will be given a function template with dynamic memory and asked to implement move semantics and ostream insertion by adding the prototypes to the class and implementing the code outside the class.

2- Function Template specialization ~7 points

You will be given a function template and asked to implement a specialization to handle a specific type in a different way

3- Lambda Expression implementation ~7 points

You will be asked to call a function which has a pointer to a function as an argument using a lambda expression capturing the neighbouring values.

4- Functor Implementation ~11 points

You will be asked to create a functor to be able to make stateful function calls (a function that remembers its previous calls)

5- Generic Ponters and low-level memory processing ~11 points

You will be asked to write a function that receives an object address in a general pointer to create a dynamic byte pattern out of the original object's pattern.





Coding & Submission Requirements
You must follow the official submission instructions provided in the YouTube video
The video clearly demonstrates how to submit your programming answers


❌ Restrictions
No reference sheets or scrap paper allowed
No smart devices (phones, smartwatches, etc.) permitted during the test
🛠️ Marking Guidelines
Your answer will receive a mark of zero in the following cases:

If your code does not relate directly to the question
(e.g., the question asks for a class that encapsulates an Employee, and you provide a Student; or it asks for a copy constructor, and you provide a copy assignment operator instead)
If your code is written in an inconsistent or unreadable style
(e.g., poor indentation, inconsistent formatting, excessive blank lines, or sloppy structure)
